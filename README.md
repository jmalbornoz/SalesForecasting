# SalesForecasting
Forecasting retails sales with PyCaret

In this author’s opinion, time series forecasting is the most challenging problem in data science. It basically requires predicting the output of a black box solely based on its past behavior. In some cases, practitioners can leverage domain knowledge to identify and incorporate key drivers influencing the output. However, most of the time, these exogenous drivers remain unknown—or, to borrow from the Rumsfeldian triad, sometimes we may not even be aware that we don’t know them!

In this repo, we will explore how PyCaret, an automated machine learning Python package, can be utilised to forecast sales in a US-based brick-and-mortar store. Our focus will be on classical and machine learning models applied to a univariate scenario. The sales time series that we will be looking represents daily sales in US dollars.
